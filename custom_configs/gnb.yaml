# gNB IP addresses
# linkIp is for internal UERANSIM radio link simulation.
# ngapIp and gtpIp are for N2 and N3 interfaces towards AMF and UPF respectively.
# In Docker, these should be the gNB container's IP/hostname on the shared network.
# 'gnb.free5gc.org' is typically the service name defined in docker-compose.
linkIp: gnb.free5gc.org # Changed from 127.0.0.1 to be consistent if radio link needs external interaction or for clarity
ngapIp: gnb.free5gc.org # gNB's local IP address for N2 Interface
gtpIp: gnb.free5gc.org # gNB's local IP address for N3 Interface

# List of supported S-NSSAIs by this gNB
# We will define the S-NSSAIs for eMBB-High and eMBB-Medium here.
# SST (Slice/Service Type) for eMBB is typically 1.
# SD (Slice Differentiator) should match what's in smfcfg.yaml.
# UERANSIM expects SD as a hexadecimal string without "0x" prefix here,
# and it should correspond to the 6 hex characters.
slices:
  - sst: 1 # For eMBB-High slice
    sd: "000065" # Matches smfcfg.yaml for eMBB-High
  - sst: 1 # For eMBB-Medium slice
    sd: "000066" # Matches smfcfg.yaml for eMBB-Medium
  # You can remove or keep the original slices below if needed for other tests,
  # but for this specific experiment, the two above are primary.
  # - sst: 1 # Original slice example 1
  #   sd: "010203"
